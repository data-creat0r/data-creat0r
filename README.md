## 💡 About me

- I started with trading and macroeconomic analysis - tracking markets, economic indicators and news to make data-driven decisions.  
- Over time this grew into a strong interest in financial data analysis: cleaning data, exploring patterns and turning numbers into insights.  
- I work confidently in Excel, including complex formulas, Power Query queries and VBA automation, practise SQL, and am actively improving my Python skills for more efficient analysis and automation.  
- I’m especially interested in macroeconomic and financial market data - above all, turning it into clear insights that support financial and investment decision-making.
- In parallel, I have experience in copywriting and content creation, which helps me explain complex ideas in simple, structured language - from short posts to longer analytical texts.
